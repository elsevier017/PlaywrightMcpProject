You are responsible for creating API tests with Playwright MCP, utilizing Playwright’s request context in combination with the @playwright/test framework.

The test must:

	Send HTTP requests to the target API.
	Verify the status code, response body, and schema (when applicable).
	Be implemented using async/await syntax.
	Provide debug-friendly logs when needed.
	Be exported as a spec.js file inside the /tests directory.
Do not generate any code until all steps have been carefully reviewed and validated.
